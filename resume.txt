i'm an entrepreneur, investor, and a lover of technology.


<span id="b"><b>deep love</b></span>
family, friendship, music, travel, and art.


<span id="b"><b>early days</b></span>
my journey began with chrono trigger, final fantasy, and ragnarok online. a quick shoutout to renegade by command and conquer: i was once ranked #2 in the world. my love for all things tech started there, with computers and video games. ragnarok, the mmorpg, taught me teamwork, communication, and economics. for my nephews reading this, it also taught me delegation. i had them grind for ore and rare items; i’m not proud of it. chrono trigger introduced me to art, music, and great storytelling. (please listen to "dreams of a shore near another world" from chrono cross.) renegade taught me about hard work and the grit needed to become the best, although i never reached #1. feel free to ask why. in truth, my journey really began thanks to my parents, who have given me everything and continue to do so. they sacrificed their freedom to support and nurture me and my siblings. to adolfo gomez and maria gomez, i am forever grateful.
